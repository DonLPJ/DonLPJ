- 👋 Hi, I’m @DonLPJ
- 👀 I’m interested in low level software development.  I have a few projects I would like to start on in the near future. I'll let you know what they are soon.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to program in x86_64 assembly (nasm), and to develop compilers and assemblers.  I'm trying to drink from a fire hydrant.
- I might write about what I am currently learning and my future projects.  This could be a good way to document my progress and (maybe) this could help someone else in future. Not sure if I will create a sight or just use an existing platform.
- I will not use AI code in any of my project. I will use it for learning new concepts from time to time.  (I know it's not truly AI, but that's the term everyone is using.)
